1. Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For this project we had to develop a program to allow the pirate in a 10x10 grid maze to find the treasure.
We had to use a machine learning algorithm to facilitate this task.  We were given most of the program functionality including the model.
We had to implement the algorithm that used this model to complete the task of getting the pirate to the treasure.  I chose the Actor-Critic deep Q learning algorithm to complete the task.


2. Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  a. What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
    Rather than just writing code without thinking too much of what the code will do or how it will be used, computer scientists develop code with the end use in mind.
   They utilize math, science, and computer technology along with software patterns to develop usable and powerful software to solve a particular challenge.
   
  b. How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  By ensuring that all of the technology and coding decisions are in the best interest of the business goal the software is meant to solve.  This should take into account cost, speed of execution, ease of use, and other factors.
  
  c. What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  Ethical responsibilities are of the utmost importance, especially when developing machine learning systems.  It is the ethical responsibility of the computer scientist to ensure that bias of any kind is kept out of the software with as much certainty as we can provide.
  This can include ensuring data sources use as many diverse inputs as possible and that the software be as inclusive as possible.  This can be represented by including things like color schemes for color-blind users and ensuring that screen readers can use the software appropriately.
